Node: these are all old. Some of the code has been changed
(like python version which uses 'fancy' heap now).

enioar 1,1 to 20.7:

  mostly-linear scanning on node deletion from heap:
    py: 15-30 ms (gc triggered?)        moon
    pl: 65-85 ms                        moon

    py: 5 ms                            silver

  fancy heap structures:
    erl: 16-19 ms                       moon

    erl: 3.5 ms                         silver
    ex:  2.7 ms                         silver

    erl: 1.8 ms                         xcite1
    ex:  1.4 ms                         -//-

    What is interesting for xcite1 is that the timings are
    the same whether it's rescaled for 1/8vcpu, 1/4 or 1vcpu.
    Looks like bigger cpu usage is handled in bursts.
    Very good outcome.


  simpler but still special heap structures:
    rkt: 20-30 ms                       moon

For ex (Elixir) see eastar repository.
